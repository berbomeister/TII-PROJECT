However , beyond the unquestionable political importance of the decision , unfortunately , speculative attacks went - and even have increased - in the last 24 hours , the famous grey zone known about support mechanism - which , President of the Council , must subsequently be clarified - and rumours with unknown origin and the objective that are spreading different options , such as the Greek opening , a few days ago , is that there was a call for a renegotiation of the agreement on 25 March .

In this regard , Parliament and the Council have the same objectives and this naturally applies everywhere , in all areas and for all institutions .
The Treaty , with the EC method thereof , implies full respect for the role of all the European institutions .
However , given this and because I can not give the EU citizens the use of tropical wood and products of Brazil , it is important that these agreements be adopted .

This is in the middle of this House behind the carpet behind you , because you are the Council , the Commission , and also Parliament .

I do not support anyone who should support me .
In crude economic climate , it is not right that the European Parliament plans to increase its costs by 2.3 % next year .
That is why it is certainly a matter that we need to look seriously at an increasingly unlikely economy that is our own .
It may be a little bit complicated , but it is , in fact , a very effective tool .
I call on the other parliamentary groups , and also the Member States of the EU , which will actually decide this issue , to insist on the same .
The future revision of remuneration systems and the creation of a European public agency is still relevant to issues that we need to deal with .
The reasons are that no real savings were made under either a budget line , and the costs often consist of the test for 2013 that we have been cutting down the road costs will probably not happen and that the negotiating procedure for this report was not transparent and aimed at excluding smaller groups with more critical outlooks on the proposed budget increases .
I voted for this report on the basis of expert opinions that say that , at the moment , both Romania and Bulgaria have proven that they are sufficiently prepared to apply in a satisfactory manner all the provisions of the Schengen acquis .
The adoption and the resulting entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has increased Parliament 's responsibility with the administrative burden that emerges from this .
The fact is that the disregard for human rights , civil liberties and the rule of law have become a common phenomenon in Russia .
In one word , and this is the only solution , everything must be done to reverse immigration flows , to compensate those who are tempted to leave their country to promote development and to ensure that families are collected in the countries of origin alone .
Croatia had problems with its neighbours , including Slovenia , but Croatia has acted in solving them .
Communication of Council common positions : see Minutes
We must therefore ensure that there are positive results from the G20 meeting on employment ministers , which was first set of time , as has just been said .
The financial crisis in Greece and the financial imbalance in other Member States has requested the need for political governance .
For now , its popularity is less than that of the ISO International Aviation Safety Authority .
We need greater integration of our social and economic policies and climate and energy policies in order to preserve jobs and create decent living and working conditions .
Therefore , taxpayers who will also have to pay for the crisis have the right to be guaranteed at least three things : firstly , greater transparency in terms of the decisions to close airports and the development of the situation .
I would like to take the opportunity to thank Mr Hahn for his work .
Immigration has more than one name , because I have expressed my fellow Members today about immigration from Africa , which mainly concerns the countries of the Mediterranean Basin , and what they have said , is , to a certain extent , rightly so .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Oettinger , like Fukushima , Chernobyl showed that , despite all the rules that we can impose , the risk of human error must be remembered , and that in this context , we must clearly specify what limits of nuclear energy , because apparently even the strictest regulations can not eliminate this residual risk as a result of human error .
This is what I believe will ultimately lead us to the wrong idea that we can not European farmers and can only import food from countries outside the EU .
At the same time , it is important to note the dangers accompanying approaches , so on , an optional nature applied to labour standards .
We , as Europe , are advocating a transition from an economy based on oil and we support renewable energy sources .
Last summer , besides fires , there were other disasters , such as some of them have taken place quite recently , last weekend , in the south of Italy .
I also hope that we will manage to reinforce the ecological dimension and not only the social dimension of this approach .
The Armenian genocide was defined - Article 3 ( 1 ) in the 1948 , as a ban on a group of use its own language in their day-to-day communication or in schools , as well as publication of books and the spread of publications on the language of the group .
By introducing amendments to the constitution in this way , without actually including other parties or civil society organisations , it undermines the democratic process , killing the dynamics and threatens to impose the exclusive right of one party .
However , the European Union is the biggest importer of fishery products from other parts of the world .
This is why the Commission 's initiative really deserves support , even with the amendments that have been adopted proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs , as there is no point in maintaining complex reporting requirements for small businesses .
I would like to stress that US waters in the ICC are the only most important factor that lowers the public and the credibility of the ICC .
The future regulation must promote and develop the industry and not limit it .
The vote on the Framework Agreement will take place at 12.00 , then there will be a break down to 8 p.m. and then proceed to the vote on the College of Commissioners - that is the order of work for today .
Firstly , I would like to say how much welcome the fact that the report discusses the need for more synergy between the two key pillars of European policy , namely development and security .
In the long term , we can only limit our dependence if agricultural policy focuses more on regional business cycles , short production rates , a high production rate and a high rate of market autonomy .
This is a strategic requirement for the introduction of the Single European Sky .
It calls for the creation of a coordination structure that meets cooperation between Member States in implementing social provisions , as well as the establishment of control bodies .
I am voting against this report .
In 2008 , 116 million European citizens were at risk of poverty and social exclusion .
They are too expensive and people travel with buses .
The EU has cofinance EUR 150 million in 2008 , EUR 120 million in 2009 and EUR 100 million in the next years .
It is time to stop this harmful circus .
The second factor is privatisation .
While food secure is one of the greatest challenges , the EU is one of the most successful projects in our time , peace , stability and prosperity in the region .
I hope in the future that we can invest in ensuring that people are responsible for working with creative activity , and ensure that piracy does not threaten their livelihoods , as is currently happening on the Internet with the illegal files of files .
We Europeans are those who will gain from the President-in-Office but the gambling will not act if emerging economies are only in a limited manner in the G20 or elsewhere .
The situation is that people who desperately need ICT instruments , because they never used them in their lives are not used to use them .
It can not be denied that the technical security of borders has no automatically made them impermeable , while there are problems with combating corruption in the judiciary and police structures .
As regards public access to information on pharmaceutical products , it seems to be the case in different parts of the European Union that the situation varies .
I would therefore like you , Commissioner , perhaps to incorporate electromobility into the future after the CARS 21 ' initiative .
I believe that the new Parliament will not delay its response , which we expect to get in February .
For its part , the commitments taken in national plans should be taken into account among the international community , ensuring greater transparency for all processes .
The national authorities must also start working on the draft application to provide a loan from the European Investment Bank so that grants grants to the necessary funds for the speedy and sustainable recovery of this region .
I am also astonished that , in the midst of an economic crisis , with a growing unemployment , where the effects of globalisation are tangible , the EGF has received and accepted so little applications from the Member States .
Mr Oettinger , you are in the process of drawing up the Energy Roadmap 2050 .
I would like to inform you that , following statements by the representatives of the political groups , I will inform you about technical procedures in connection with the report 's vote .
However , it is necessary to create mechanisms for listing and monitoring , given that I have stated in favour of the report on the amendment of the European Parliament 's Rules of Procedure , following the establishment of a common register for the registration and monitoring of organisations and persons involved in drafting and implementing policies of the European Union .
In connection with the design of policies , the Council 's EUPOL is carrying out mentoring and training , and the Commission supports the Afghan National Police Authority by the Afghan Fund ( Afghan ) .
The euro has provided stability and conditions for creating millions of new jobs and this should not be forgotten in these days when everyone speaks about a crisis .
We are living in unprecedented times .
We believe that this requirement will not result in proven security benefits and will constitute an obstacle to trade .
The contradiction is nationalism and protectionism , which were rejected for 50 years , from the Community 's current headquarters .
Croatia 's accession negotiations have recently developed well .
This legal act must enter into force as soon as possible .
We will do exactly the opposite .
I urge Mrs Wallström , which is a great advocate of minorities , to remind President Barroso to honour his promise that the future Commissioner for Fundamental Rights will deal with minority rights , including minorities of indigenous people themselves , of immigrant minorities and Roma .
If we consider global how other major regions act , how they conclude agreements and deal with their partners from a strategic perspective , we can undoubtedly see that all of them are developing more quickly .
These materials must be investigated under the current strict rules on protecting human health and the environment .
There must be a different approach and decisions and discuss with Parliament immediately , and this has not happened until now .
The accession will actually provide citizens with new means of action : they will now be able to raise a case in the European Court of Human Rights if their fundamental rights are violated by a European institution or a Member State of action or a withdrawal of their country .
This decision is wise and right .
The sector 's sector is a sector of growth that is developing faster than many other economic areas .
Do not augur that we will do it , but the option remains open to us .
Negotiations are also essential to restore the State funds to which temporary suspension of EU development aid amounting to EUR 600 million was suspended .
Under Article 150 of the Rules of Procedure , a list of statements by 30 MEPs will be raised so as to maintain a representative political and geographical balance .
We are aware of the growing number of falsified medicinal products sold in sale , with the number of them reaching millions .
Two weeks ago , the donor conference in New York has reached EUR 7 billion or , at least , the promised amount .
Only such bilateral agreements are necessary and I therefore welcome them .
The more is increasing the exchange of information at a higher level , the opportunity to prevent the risk of a more expensive or incorrect transposition .
I would also like this time , as well as the part-session in Strasbourg held by the February of the February of the violent objections to the resolution on the alleged use of European countries from the CIA to transport and illegally arrest of alleged terrorists .
Today , we are faced with at least three parallel crises - the financial , climate and what I would call a crisis of ecosystems , or the excessive use of natural resources .
We need data but we are aware that the data on ethnic origin are always sensitive and we must be careful when we are demanding and working with them .
( HU ) Madam President , here in the European Parliament , we have witnessed an unprecedented event .
How can we not be satisfied that , on two of the issues that serious concern Europeans - the crisis and climate change - Europe is finally on top positions ?
It is living in its territory a quarter of the world 's population .
We can not really say that we want to get one thing , but to do anything else .
This policy has become more integrated with the EU 's foreign policy .
Free trade is a good thing !
In this regard , it is enough to look at what relations Turkey has with other Member States , such as Greece and Cyprus , or with one country outside the European Union , as Armenia is .
patient rights in cross-border healthcare ( debate )
Let us streamline the European defence market .
Using innovative solutions should lead to lower costs for businesses and enable consumers to enjoy cheaper and better products .
We need to be careful when we discuss access to documents and transparency , not to streamline and open documentation and procedures to a degree where the whole system is unacceptable .
I am personally prepared for a compromise solution .
specialists must provide the necessary resources to develop innovative driving hours for measuring time and minimise the frequency , so that they can work under the necessary conditions , because ultimately they protect all of us .
The Commission has already started public procurement procedures - within the framework of programmes , the CIP , CIP and percentages - in support of the construction of networks of public procurement bodies .
Better regulation of political parties and their political foundations will also contribute to transparency .
In 2003 , according to the consultation received by this consultation , the Commission published a plan for action that is proposed , among other things , introducing a common reference framework contained in definitions , common principles and the rules in order to improve the quality and consistency of European contract law in another communication in 2004 .
Furthermore , I consider it appropriate that European energy ministers have decided to give priority to safety in European nuclear power plants , emphasising the importance of better coordination at European level during the modernisation of nuclear installations .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
Finally , and I would like to thank Mr Šefčovič , who has a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement , and the representative of the Hungarian Government , among other things , to the assurances that the Council will join the agreement in the near future , which will undoubtedly have its own ambiguities , as the Council undoubtedly plays the role of the second chamber .
The agreement is expected to be able to generate consumer surplus ( benefits in the form of lower fares ) of EUR 460 million .
We should not forget , however , that they serve only technical preparation and preparation for a political decision .
This is a real problem in all Member States and I will emphasise once again that it is not only about our regulations but also the national provisions affecting European funds .
The key is clearly that the mechanism has been designed so that it can be fully incorporated into the Union system in future .
We must not be sorry to be avoided .
It means lower energy bills , not higher and it improves energy security .
The Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the Union has competence to commit to supporting , coordination or complementing Member States ' actions .
In my own country , for example , our budget contributions will increase by 60 % over the next 12 months .
lobbyists are a big issue and lobbying is a big matter , and we must continue to work in this direction , to use this as experiment and hopefully that the registration will be made compulsory in future .
I would also like to add that I do not know who , with whom representatives of the EU , are the talk about .
However , in Europe , we obviously need to find some common approach to the methodology for assessing possible risks .
Please do not make a distinction between Mr Oettinger , the former treasurer , Commissioner Oettinger .
In 2008 , the Commission tabled a proposal for a Council regulation on the conservation of fish stocks through technical measures that had to replace the previous regulation .
As has been mentioned , over 100 000 flights were cancelled , tens of thousands of passengers , working or in the holiday , they could not travel according to their plans , delayed or ever more freight remained goods and cargo affected by businesses and our European carriers and airports have suffered catastrophic financial losses .
I also believe that macroeconomic aid will have a positive impact on Georgia 's relations with the Member States , in addition to the crucial role that will play in the proper implementation of the reforms by the government .
I voted in favour of this report because , as the largest donor of humanitarian aid globally , the EU must pay greater attention to humanitarian aid in these areas where it is urgently needed , given the dramatic rise in the number of natural disasters and internal conflicts .
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous impact assessment structure within Parliament , which all parliamentary committees should use to create more synergies .
I am pleased to see what you have said today that you want to meet almost monthly , because your work is to bring back to the Heads of State or Government and the Member States back in Europe .
The Commission has received answers from all 27 Member States and a document that has been submitted to these answers will be published over the next six months .
However , the arbitrary creation of new projects and organisations for facilitating these objectives runs counter to the budgetary realities throughout the EU .
Therefore , in today 's vote , we voted against the compromise .
I believe it is absolutely right to raise the issue of the importance of being visible in the ground .
The people who manage the cities are particularly responsible .
The members of the committee were of the opinion that such a ban would be irrelevant .
I have received my vote on confidence in the Commission team , which will be led by José Manuel Barroso , as they have shown good technical preparation , serious and ambition with which to respond to the challenges facing the EU without forgetting the values underlying it , namely solidarity and territorial cohesion .
And for many times , there has been one single joke : Europe .
According to official statistics , the Russian economy is growing at a rate of 4 % , despite the economic situation , and it is expected to maintain a long time .
It remains only now to end the climate conference in Copenhagen - the last and most important task , with the greatest long-term effect .
The Republic of Moldova is a European country under its history and geographical location .
As regards the accusation of my actions , I will only point out that there were various attempts to reverse my own , but there has never been a criminal investigation , not because the Austrian judges and public prosecutor were searched , but because they were very unfounded .
Some of these proposals , I can add , are already a fact or are on the way to make it happen .
The Czech Presidency will follow the problem and will take further steps on behalf of the EU if this is needed , and will continue to put this issue in our contacts with the competent authorities in Minsk .
This can contribute to changing the trend towards reducing the number of protected consumers during travel .
I believe that , despite the emergency situation , decisions which are important for the European Union must be taken calmly and respecting the principle of solidarity and equal rights of all Member States .
( SV ) As many countries and Sweden , where I am , I am , is highly dependent on the car industry .
This concerns primarily craftspeople , which in Europe does not have a single standard for measuring qualifications .
We want to see the list of regulations and internal legislative acts that Member States want to retain .
The summit must lead to concrete solutions , particularly as regards cooperation on cleaning up the areas of Innovative and Joint Research and Development in the field of renewable energy .
I strongly condemn the practice of violence against women , and also children , in recent conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa , and I would like to call for the most suitable measures to be taken to protect their most fundamental rights and their dignity .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission would be in favour of postponing the vote .
There are many petitions in this regard .
Finally , in order to avoid distortion of competition , it is essential that a third country fund , the EU is given a passport and can carry out its activities if they observe the same conditions as EU funds are respected .
Their role is becoming more explicit by day .
Vice-President of the Commission . - The Commission knows that there are several other third countries that still do not recognise the principle of reciprocity in respect of all EU Member States .
Voting time
However , we can not blame workers , small farmers or entrepreneurs for this situation .
We do not have money for the sake of money .
It can not be said freely or speak of the opinion .
It should be possible to reduce the existing 60 blocs and control centres up to 15 - 20 .
Furthermore , it is clear that innovation and research are both sides of the coin .
These exemptions will benefit the outermost regions .
Let me say a few words about the EU 's guidance .
I am pleased with the compromise reached on this regulation in the course of negotiations between the three institutions , and I obviously also welcome the spirit of cooperation and the willingness to compromise that prevailed in the three institutions during the entire negotiations .
In the current difficult economic situation , we can not afford to ignore the opportunities contained in the current agreement on our two regions in terms of employment and growth .
Instead , Europe could use culture in foreign affairs as a two-way street , that is , at the same time , to learn and learn , as well as to maintain fruitful dialogue with other major regional blocs like Mercosur or the Association of South-East Asia ( ASEAN ) .
I therefore still believe that , by engaging with Turkmenistan , we will be in a better position to offer our arguments to the benefit of a more prosperous society in this country .
The proposed EU action plan with 12 points relating to the Millennium Development Goals was also addressed .
The fact that there is also a shortage of donors , and that this feeds some terrible criminal activities .
The aim is also to increase flexibility , to reform , as you say , to the labour market - in other words , to create flexicurity without security .
The report drafted by EU support has concluded that , by 125 million citizens are affected by energy poverty .
The Commission 's system of response to humanitarian emergency was at the same time triggered in Brussels and in the regional office of the European Commission for humanitarian aid in the 15th External Action Service .
It does not deal with the fundamental issue , namely to ensure a credible defence of Europe and cooperation with NATO on an equal footing .
In fact , Article 182 of the Treaty of Lisbon guarantees the legal basis for future developments in this area .
( Applause )
One of them is the proposal for a single EU foreign policy .
A good example is the common agricultural policy .
We need better control of external borders , more security , we need biometric data and we need our interconnected messages .
It will suffer those who need credit .
Fourthly , the Commission must bear political responsibility .
In this situation , I support the promotion and extension of Erasmus programmes for young entrepreneurs and Erasmus for the likes of working workers ' .
This report calls for the strengthening of fundamental standards relating to employment enshrined in the ILO conventions , and include freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in the workplace and the end of child labour .
Its global cocaine , poverty ( 80 % of India 's population live with less than USD 2 per day ) and diseases .
Commissioner , thank you for your information on the Commission 's activities .
This represents a strong message of Parliament that action is needed .
However , the police must also sit down and listen to .
This is nothing to do with the party policy ; it is simply a fact .
We must ensure that they have sufficient information about the product and so on , so that they can make a wise and informed choice .
These views will be taken into account as far as possible , taking account the realities and specificities of this particular negotiation process into account .
In short , every gesture and every action that intensify the importance of human rights are important and we must speak openly about this , particularly in the case of countries where fundamental human rights are violated .
That is incomprehensible .
We expect Russian troops to be withdrawn from Abkhazia and South Ossetia and Russia to respect the right of Georgia to decide their future .
I would like to mention the case of Turkey .
( EL ) Madam President , I too would like to raise the question of tar sands ; this is a question of the question , as it is the reason why we have similar agreement with Canada - an international agreement on the Kyoto Protocol - is not respected .
I firmly believe , Commissioner , that the European Parliament will be pleased to help you in implementing this task .
The introduction of these systems must be completed .
To date , what the European Commission has negotiated throughout the world is the opposite of equality .
Perhaps if we were to decide what we were to allocate to those who were to be before we were to go to production , we would spend a far less than if we were to sell it on the market and we would have a policy to support certain markets in crisis such as the dairy market .
At the same time , Mr Dalli , we have the obligation to inform everyone who choose to spend their holidays in a European country on the rights that they have had up to now and , more importantly , to inform it about the gaps and improvements that we want to do .
Of course , the analysts of the market can well read between the stress tests and another similar information and evaluate what is happening in the balances of banks .
The proposal largely draws inspiration from the European Regulation on CO2 emissions from light vehicles , which is in force since 2008 .
Serbia has hidden potential that must be realised on its path to EU membership and should do so on behalf of its own interest and in the name of the interests of its neighbours , the region as a whole and the European Union .
While I am strongly criticising the approach to the whole of the European Union , I agree with the approach of the whole island .
This was confirmed by the European Commission , and last week we confirmed it and we in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , without one voice against .
For Belarus , and also for Ukraine , the Ukrainian system of Russia , characterised by a flexible approach to foreign policy and a firm approach in internal politics and oppression , is clearly more attractive and more than the EU can offer .
In this House , we must unequivocally state that the same rights as the citizens of other free European countries , and this includes the right to demonstrate freely in Minsk today , when it comes to 91 years from the independence of Belarus .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
I would like to say that we would like to look more to the present and future than to the past .
The new organisation I support will make the programme more efficient and modern , both in terms of agricultural policy and from a social perspective .
In this context , I have the following question : how can it be positive to the fact that in Canada , an area of an area of Austria 's area of area is destroyed every year in connection with the exploitation of these tar sands and that the entire livelihoods of indigenous communities are destroyed ?
Officially , we do not have access to this information , but through international organisations , NGOs , academics , political parties and , so on , we are receiving information - which is quite incoherent - for the situation of political prisoners .
You should also give pressure on the Welsh nuclear lobbyists of the United Kingdom , which leads us to the main theme .
The vote underlines that there is no equality between Member States and in no political group there is no solidarity .
There are currently new technologies which can fundamentally improve transport safety ( for example , electronic control systems ) or reduce the amount of CO2 emissions ( for example , tyre low resistance ) if such technologies are regarded as standard of new vehicles .
It reflects an extremely impressive socialist approach of governance and control over economic policy , which is not appropriate to address the problems of the 21st century .
Such restrictions also exist in terms of access to tender in third countries .
As a champion of civil rights , I have a duty to oppose this decision .
The populists is rapidly increasing and represent a real risk for Europe .
Finally , I can assure you that I have followed developments closely in food prices and , in future , I would like to work , I am addressing you here in Parliament and the Council on this issue , so that it will come forward with concrete proposals , above all with the reform of the common agricultural policy , but also with other , more robust instruments .
This is what I would call in my country , one of the European Parliament 's most formal dossiers .
The Eastern Partnership does not have an attempt to control this area or extend its sphere of influence .
A more Europe is also a driving force for innovation ; to strengthen Europe 's competitiveness , high-speed trains , transmission networks of electricity on a remote distance and high-tech transmission networks .
We voted in favour of the own-initiative report highlighting gender aspects , with privatisations , condemns various situations and insisting on a set of measures to combat discrimination against women .
Many of them apply for asylum in European countries .
Only then will I decide to vote in favour of further counterterrorism laws .
In this way , the European Union 's strategic reserve for combating forest fires proved its usefulness to be reaffirmed .
The figures show that this is a useful tool , and 54 000 orders were issued for arrest and 12 000 have been met .
For example , the process must be improved in which licence is issued for oil drilling or given the facilities of third countries .
I have therefore chosen to vote against the report as a whole , but I am positively addressing some parts of the proposal and voted in favour .
In some Member States , it is possible to imagine one more than EUR 1 000 .
However , the last attempt is not so encouraging compared to the two Members said yesterday during the debate on several Members .
In view of this , we want to introduce some new situations , including contracts between enterprises and between enterprises and consumers regulated by an optional instrument which will extend the choice of the contractual parties and establishing a monitoring and revision mechanism to ensure that the optional instrument is agreed with market needs and legal and economic developments .
I therefore supported this report .
The motion for a resolution is empty words aimed at making people forget that Parliament can only accept or reject .
There is no reason for us to wait for the Commission 's procedure .
The debate is closed .
It has successfully included as part of the motion for a resolution , the need for Member States to implement measures aimed at achieving territorial cohesion .
Parliament even allocates EUR 5 million from the European Union budget for this year , in order to facilitate the implementation of this clause .
If the rapporteur had to present the report on the initiative on Monday evening , it would have four minutes .
There must be no confusion in jungle of vague charges and payments .
Innovation encourages synergies between traditional and artisanal areas of activity .
This does not mean that we do not respect the fundamental values of the EU , or that we do not fully respect the requirements laid down in European and international law .
Firstly , the first and principal objective of structural policy must be to promote real cohesion , the bridging role of a tool for redistribution , in terms of costs , inequalities and inequalities caused by the internal market , economic and monetary union and the liberalisation of global trade , for countries and regions in the European Union , which are the least developed in economic terms .
This modern slavery is deeply etched in poverty and exclusion , and therefore the elimination of unacceptable living conditions in which many Roma are set , must be a major strategic objective .
I hope that will remain so .
Japan is currently in need of real help .
It will offer an alternative source to this in the Nabucco project .
National management declarations should help us to a significant extent to see how these monies are used by national authorities and who is responsible for using these funds .
In the South-East Europe , the definition of synergies is where there is the ability of a group to go even its best individual .
As far as the financial side is concerned , I asked the initial proposal to be reconsidered .
Mr President , the Stockholm Programme is part of the creation of a common legal and judicial system in the European Union .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , if everything is simple and clear , as some speakers have said this afternoon , let the European Commission , as an executive , to establish whether the Hungarian text is legally compatible with the basic principles of the European Union 's platform and things will clarify .
Furthermore , the report claims that the reduction in the budget will jeopardise European solidarity and economic development .
( PL ) Mr President , in the second half of September this year , Russia and Belarus conducted military exercises with the Armenians in the West ' and the South Atlantic Alliance of Nuclear Power Plant .
Fortunately , my country , Ireland , is a member of the euro area , as the current currency is a source of stability for Ireland and for other countries at the present time of unprecedented turmoil and a global recession .
With regard to the vicious rehabilitation of the European Bank for Development , which is a risky tool financed by the EDF to promote private investment in the context of the difficult economic and political circumstances for ACP countries , I have very mixed feelings of the idea that the EIB should present a report as part of the discharge procedure , but this will be the subject of debate , especially if Parliament hopes that the Union will become more dynamic in the EIB .
Consequently , the provisions laid down by Directive 2003/37/EC relating to agricultural and forestry tractors , their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery , together with their systems , components and separate technical units , apply to this directive .
On 11 March , Japan has been hit by a strong earthquake , followed by the tsunami , which caused the greatest nuclear crisis in the history of the country , following the Fukushima nuclear plant , has suffered serious structural damage since since it was at the immediate risk of triggering a nuclear catastrophe on a huge scale .
I share the rapporteur 's view .
We realise that another framework is needed for compliance with international law .
Mr President , I will quote John Monks and I will continue to be Swedish , if all humanity had one of the same opinion , and only one person would be on a person who would not have a more than a person who would have a person to do so , if he had the authority , would have had such power , it would have the right to make mankind to attack .
This result will be very well confronted by performers in the EU .
Innovation Union will use public money in the best way .
We would like to hear the Commissioner 's speech , Viviane Reding , on these issues .
I would like to send a very clear message to the Commission .
We would like to see it .
I call on the Council and the Commission to choose unequivocally the Nabucco project .
It seems to be blind to the problems in this area .
Moreover , the earthquake hit the poorest country of the western hemisphere , where 80 % of the population live below the poverty line , and 54 % - in the end of poverty .
I sincerely ask you to support this compromise .
The Council of Europe is currently working on a new anti-discrimination regulation , and I would like to draw attention to three aspects .
That is something we oppose .
Finally , I hope that efforts will be made to deal with delays .
There was no link between the two .
The links between the EU and Ukraine have always been closely and based on constructive dialogue .
These are the only power stations that are completely safe .
The most recent examples are the cases of people who are extradited to interrogation without being handed over .
In what extent and where do the different Member States have exceeded their rail lines and trains with national systems for the dealer ?
So the banks are working .
I am voting in favour of the motion for a resolution because I am convinced that the accession negotiations with Croatia can be completed during the first semester of 2011 , provided that the implementation of the necessary reforms continue .
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission 's declarations of declarations on
It provides more clarity , as the provisions governing a subject are often spread in different legislative texts .
It is important to preserve the two-pillar structure of two pillars , to maintain direct payments and , in particular , a strong rural development policy , to increase competitiveness and strengthen ecological awareness .
Origin marking is not a one-way street ; it is a commitment to transparency in trade rules and to combating unfair competition .
Our idea , I hope you will agree with it , is that the Commission should coordinate the initiative .
